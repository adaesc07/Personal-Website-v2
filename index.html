        <h1>Adan's website</h1>
        <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Feline</p>

        <p style="color: crimson;">They move like shadows, silent and sure,
            Golden eyes gleaming, wild and pure.
            Masters of mystery, wrapped in grace,
            Soft-footed hunters in moonlight’s embrace.
            
            A flick of the tail, a whisper, a sigh,
            Perched on high places, watching you try.
            Independent yet yearning, distant yet near,
            They purr in your lap, dissolving your fear.
            
            Night-born dancers, rulers of dreams,
            Carrying secrets in their silken seams.
            In a world too loud, too fast, too bright,
            A cat is a pause—soft, still, and right.</p>
